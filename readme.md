This is back-end code repo of my developing-back-employeesmanagerapp.
In this repo, the restful API will be built and connected to db.

As a Stack and third party libraries, dev dependencies etc:

1. Node JS
2. Express JS
3. Mongo DB
4. Mongoose
5. Nodemon
6.

This is the first project that is designed and coded by me. In some concepts, I don't know what I am doing. Because I haven't seen them in anywhere, I just thought that it may be possible to do like this and I did. I will list thoso below

1.

### My mistakes for this project:

1. I did have some idea about routes but not in depth. But thing is, during development I need more ready material to work on.

2. I understand that it was very important to have clear(solid) roadmap of building app. So kinda todos in user friendly interface life trello.

### Weak sides of project or my mistakes in terms of code which I chose

1. I always response success: 'done' or any other stupid response which don't give any information about process.

2. if in client side email is updated which passible ith new route, application will be broken.
